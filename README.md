# 💖 Do You Wanna Go Out With Me? Website

A playful and interactive website that asks the classic question:  
**"Do you wanna go out with me?"**  

Built with **HTML, CSS, and a little bit of JavaScript** magic ✨.  
If the user clicks **"Yes"**, they are greeted with a celebratory page.  
If they try to click **"No"**, the button playfully runs away 🏃💨.
